How To Use :
Simply, create an empty BoidController gameObject,
and child as many boid(prefabs) bodies as you want to it. 
how to use on 3D:
you can simply change the colliders to be 3D. and change the prefab into a 3D Object. 
or, you can, parent your 3D Object to the Actual Boid Body, and turn off your 3D OBject colliders, and then, offset and rotate the circle collider to fit your need.

Note:
tweak the priorities to change how the behavior functions. (at the boid controller script)


this is made solely for hopes of it helping everyone who finds it. i hope
it turns out useful.
